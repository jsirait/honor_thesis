A biography is provided for editor-in-chief Eric Rubin. \nAlthough the journal publishes lists every six months identifying peer reviewers who reviewed two or more studies in that time frame, it does not identify who reviewed specific studies, thereby foregoing transparency that might shed light on the qualifications of a reviewer to review a specific article. The journal considers confidentiality of these reviews an important aspect of its process. In March 2008, a federal court denied pharmaceutical company Pfizer\u2019s request to compel NEJM to release peer-review comments and unpublished manuscripts on research regarding two Pfizer drugs.\n\u201cAs we did in this case, we will resist any future attempts to undermine peer review, in the interest of the Journal and of those who offer their time and expertise as reviewers,\u201d then-editor-in-chief Jeffrey Drazen and other NEJM editors wrote in an editorial published in May 2008. \u201cWe want to assure our reviewers that we value their comments and will keep them confidential.\u201d\nArticles often name multiple authors, provide contact information for one of them, and identify academic or professional affiliations. Published articles will list sponsors of the studies and include authors\u2019 financial disclosure forms, listing payments such as consulting fees they have  received from health care or pharmaceutical companies.\nAfter Drazen began his tenure as editor-in-chief in 2000, the journal loosened some of its conflict of interest standards, which had prohibited authors with any financial ties to companies from writing editorials or reviews of medical literature that related to those companies\u2019 products, Drazen\u2019s new policy, introduced in 2002, states that only authors who receive more than $10,000 annually from a single company would be barred from participating in reviews.\nA three-part series of 2015 editorials by NEJM correspondent Lisa Rosenbaum questioned whether concerns over doctors\u2019 ties to the pharmaceutical industry have become overblown. In the second editorial, titled \u201cUnderstanding Bias \u2014 The Case for Careful Study,\u201d Rosenbaum used the term \u201cpharmascold\u201d to describe people worried about industry influence on medical research, arguing their concerns over potential conflicts of interest has resulted in \u201ca stifling of honest discourse and potential discouragement of productive collaborations.\u201d\nThe series was criticized by former NEJM editors-in-chief Marcia Angell and Jerome Kassirer and former senior editor Robert Steinbrook in an essay published by medical journal The BMJ. \u201cDrug and device companies are investor owned businesses that are required to maximize profits by any legal means,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThese companies are not charities, so they expect to get something in return for all the largesse; the evidence is that they do, and it is naive to explain the situation otherwise.\u201d\nNEJM allows study authors to update their financial disclosures long after publication. For example, Jose Baselga, chief medical officer at New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, altered financial disclosures in October 2018 on studies published in the journal after The New York Times and ProPublica reported that he had failed to disclose millions of dollars he had received from health care companies. For example, Baselga was a co-author on two articles, published in August 2015 and July 2017, about clinical trials for the drugs owned by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche. He initially did not disclose that he received more than $3 million from Roche and its subsidiaries in 2014 and 2015 for consulting work and Roche buying out Baselga\u2019s ownership stake in Seragon Pharmaceuticals. \nNEJM said in a correction notice that when the journal \u201clearned of this breach of trust,\u201d it relayed those concerns to Memorial Sloan Kettering. Baselga subsequently resigned.\nWhile Zeis responded to NewsGuard\u2019s initial March 2019 email, she did not respond to two follow-up emails and a phone call seeking comment on the journal not identifying peer reviewers for individual articles and its conflict of interest policy. She also did not respond to two additional emails sent in June 2020 and June 2021. \nAdvertisements are distinguishable from editorial content.", "history": "The New England Journal of Medicine is the oldest continuously published general medical journal in the world.

The sites feature written articles, videos, and photo galleries.", "credibility": "The sites\u2019 reporting generally cites reputable sources, such as police, government officials, people with firsthand knowledge of events, subject experts, and primary documents. Headlines accurately reflect story content.", "transparency": "The Gannett newspaper sites share a common website template, resulting in similar transparency and disclosure practices across the sites in the network.\nMost sites in the network disclose their ownership by Gannett on the Contact Us page. A small percentage of the sites do not contain such a disclosure. However, because most of the sites do so, NewsGuard has determined that the network meets NewsGuard\u2019s criterion for clearly disclosing ownership.\nSites in the network typically list the authors\u2019 names at the top of each article and provide a link to a short biography on a separate page. Because many of the sites in the network share content with each other, clicking the link to view an author\u2019s biography will sometimes bring the user to a different website in the network to view the biography. Article bylines typically note which Gannet-owned publication originally produced the article.\nIn some cases, articles do not list any author\u2019s name, instead using generic attributions such as \u201cStaff Report\u201d or \u201cSpecial to The Express.\u201d\nBecause most articles on sites in the network contain bylines that link to author biographies, NewsGuard has determined that the network meets NewsGuard\u2019s standard for providing information about content creators.\nThe sites typically include a Staff Directory, and some of the sites list the names and email addresses of editors on that page. However, NewsGuard\u2019s review of the sites in August 2021 found that most of the sites do not list the names of any editorial leaders. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the network does not meet its standard for revealing who is in charge of content.\nAdvertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.\nWhen asked about the sites in the network that do not provide information about editorial leadership, Hayley Hoefer, Senior Manager for PR and Corporate Communications at Gannett Co., said that the omissions are the result of the sites\u2019 recent move to a new digital publishing system.\n\u201cWe aim for full transparency across all our websites. This includes Gannett ownership information and staffing information,\u201d  Hoefer said. \u201cThere may be instances, like the example you shared, where during our integration to a single CMS across the company, some information didn't port over.

Articles draw on relevant sources such as eyewitnesses to events, government officials, and academics. The site also publishes information from credible news outlets, such as wire agency PA, The Times, and The Guardian. Headlines accurately represent the content.", "transparency": "Standard.co.uk articles typically name the writer, and link to an author page containing the author\u2019s other work. However, no biographical or contact information is provided \u2014 which does not meet NewsGuard\u2019s standard for providing information about its content creators.\nArnold told NewsGuard in an email in April 2019 that the site intended to add biographical and contact information to its author pages beginning in the summer of 2019, although at the time of NewsGuard\u2019s January 2020 review, no such information had been added. Arnold told NewsGuard in January 2020 that the implementation of a new content management system (CMS) had delayed this goal, and that \u201cThe aim is to have author biographical information and contacts launched as part of the new CMS and refreshed website \u2013 hopefully going live at the end of Q2 of 2020.\u201d\nStandard.co.uk identifies its senior editors, including Osborne, and names its section editors, alongside their contact details. However, the site does not disclose Osborne\u2019s former government roles.\nAsked about this, Arnold noted that the Standard\u2019s Code of Conduct & Complaints page features a section concerning conflicts of interest, which states that the publication\u2019s journalists \u201cshould be transparent about any outside political, philosophical, religious or financial interests that might conflict with your journalistic independence or integrity, or could be perceived to do so.\u201d\nNonetheless, Osborne\u2019s outside interests and past government roles are not disclosed on the site, despite the fact that they have previously been publicly characterised as potential conflicts of interest by the Financial Times, the Labour Party, and right-wing politics blog Guido Fawkes, among others. NewsGuard has therefore concluded that the site does not adequately disclose information about its leaders, including possible conflicts of interest.\nThe site\u2019s ownership is not disclosed in a clear manner. ESI is mentioned in the site\u2019s Privacy Policy, and a link at the bottom of the website, titled \u201cAdvertisers,\u201d leads to the ESI Media website. Articles written about or by Evgeny Lebedev typically identify him as the newspaper\u2019s owner, but he is not identified as the owner in a standing location on the site.\nAsked about the site\u2019s lack of ownership information, Arnold noted that the site does state that it is \u201cowned and operated by Evening Standard Ltd\u201d on its Terms of Use page, and that the company\u2019s shareholder information is available on the website of the British national business registry, Companies House.\nHowever, because the site does not itself feature this information in an easily accessible manner, Standard.co.uk does not meet NewsGuard\u2019s standard for the disclosure of ownership.\nThe site sometimes derives revenue from purchases made through links in its product reviews, but does not always disclose the arrangement. For some articles, such as those published in the Standard\u2019s ES Best section, the site runs a disclosure stating: \u201cES Best product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust. On some occasions, we earn revenue if you click the links and buy the products, but we never allow this to bias our coverage.\u201d\nHowever, NewsGuard found multiple articles outside the ES Best section that also endorsed products and contained similar revenue-generating links, but without a disclosure. Examples included \u201cES Loves: What our fashion editor wants for Christmas\u201d and \u201cDenim trends 2020: the jeans styles to shop in the sales\u201d, both published in December 2019. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the site does meet the standard for distinguishing paid content from editorial content.\nArnold told NewsGuard in a December 2020 email that, since NewsGuard\u2019s last inquiry, \u201coutside of the ES Best section, journalists were tasked with adding disclaimers manually where needed\u201d. She added that the site was \u201cnow putting together a policy document to ensure this policy is extend[ed] to other relevant sections to improve transparency.\u201d  \nArnold also noted that \u201cOver the course of the last year we also improved the transparency of our core affiliate linking platforms Shopping and ES Best; the disclaimer is now coded into each piece to guarantee its placement within the article, effectively automating the process\u201d and that \u201cFor particularly high volume shopping articles either in ES Best or outside of the section (eg on Black Friday) where there is an above average amount of affiliate content compared to traditional articles, we moved the disclaimer to the very top of the article so as to be more visible.\u201d", "history": "The Standard was first published in 1827 as a morning paper, and began to also publish in the evening in 1859.

However, NewsGuard\u2019s review of the sites in August 2021 found that most of the sites do not list the names of any editorial leaders. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the network does not meet its standard for revealing who is in charge of content.\nAdvertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.\nWhen asked about the sites in the network that do not provide information about editorial leadership, Hayley Hoefer, Senior Manager for PR and Corporate Communications at Gannett Co., said that the omissions are the result of the sites\u2019 recent move to a new digital publishing system.\n\u201cWe aim for full transparency across all our websites.

Headlines accurately reflect story content.", "transparency": "The Gannett newspaper sites share a common website template, resulting in similar transparency and disclosure practices across the sites in the network.\nMost sites in the network disclose their ownership by Gannett on the Contact Us page. A small percentage of the sites do not contain such a disclosure. However, because most of the sites do so, NewsGuard has determined that the network meets NewsGuard\u2019s criterion for clearly disclosing ownership.\nSites in the network typically list the authors\u2019 names at the top of each article and provide a link to a short biography on a separate page. Because many of the sites in the network share content with each other, clicking the link to view an author\u2019s biography will sometimes bring the user to a different website in the network to view the biography.

However, NewsGuard\u2019s review of the sites in August 2021 found that most of the sites do not list the names of any editorial leaders. Therefore, NewsGuard has determined that the network does not meet its standard for revealing who is in charge of content.\nAdvertising and sponsored content are distinguishable from editorial content.\nWhen asked about the sites in the network that do not provide information about editorial leadership, Hayley Hoefer, Senior Manager for PR and Corporate Communications at Gannett Co., said that the omissions are the result of the sites\u2019 recent move to a new digital publishing system.\n\u201cWe aim for full transparency across all our websites. This includes Gannett ownership information and staffing information,\u201d  Hoefer said. \u201cThere may be instances, like the example you shared, where during our integration to a single CMS across the company, some information didn't port over.

# Investigating News Sources Representations and Characterizations using their Reddit Audience-based Metrics

This repo contains mainly the Jupyter Notebooks used to scrape, manage, analyze, and visualize the datasets used in Junita's undergraduate Computer Science honors thesis, advised by Professor Eni Mustafaraj. 

This thesis builds representation (embeddings) for news sources based on Reddit audience-based metrics. The embeddings are evaluated using classification and regression models.

The actual thesis is `thesis.pdf`. The thesis can also be found at Wellesley College's official thesis repository: [https://repository.wellesley.edu/object/ir1768](https://repository.wellesley.edu/object/ir1768).

# Some ideas to pursue:

1. Page rank algorithm to rank news sources based on their links to other news sources of particular importance
    Questions:
    a. Can we run page rank algorithm with undirected edges?
    b. Can we incorporate node attributes such as weight for page rank algorithm?
    
2. Compare and contrast embeddings using *shallow encoders* and *GNN embedding*.
   We can quantify the difference by using the accuracy in downstream tasks such as classification.
   This can be used to see if **structure** alone is enough to characterize news sources or if we need other information such 
   as the details provided by Wikidata and Muck Rack.
   
3. Can we use GNN with weighted edges???


# Decisions to make (or made but can be changed):

1. For news sources that are divided further into individualized news pages (like podcasts on `anchor.fm`, 
    do we consider it as one news source or do we count each individual news page as distinct news source?
    => I am thinking as one news source `anchor.fm`. However, for now, I add both `subdomain.domain.suffix`
       and `domain.suffix` into Muck Rack collections to be intersected with GDELT's.
       

# Data notes:

1. There are 457882 news sources in `muckrack_union.json`. There 60490 news sources in the intersection between old and new Muck Rack.
2. There are 205994 news sources in `gdelt`.
3. There are 42477 news sources in  both Muck Rack and GDELT.
4. There are 3289 news sources in MBFC.
5. There are 1631 news sources in all GDELT, Muck Rack, and MBFC


# Daily 1-sentence log

12 Feb I worked on Colab 1 from Stanford CS224W to train node embedding
18 Feb I should make a heatmap graphic x = number of occurence of newssource 1; y = number of occurence of newssource 2;
        z = contribution formula
       Then another heatmap graphic x = contribution; y = number of subscribers; z = overall total weight.

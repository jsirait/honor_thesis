## Some ideas to pursue:

1. Page rank algorithm to rank news sources based on their links to other news sources of particular importance
    Questions:
    a. Can we run page rank algorithm with undirected edges?
    b. Can we incorporate node attributes such as weight for page rank algorithm?
    
2. Compare and contrast embeddings using *shallow encoders* and *GNN embedding*.
   We can quantify the difference by using the accuracy in downstream tasks such as classification.
   This can be used to see if **structure** alone is enough to characterize news sources or if we need other information such 
   as the details provided by Wikidata and Muck Rack.
   
3. Can we use GNN with weighted edges???


## Decisions to make (or made but can be changed):

1. For news sources that are divided further into individualized news pages (like podcasts on `anchor.fm`, 
    do we consider it as one news source or do we count each individual news page as distinct news source?
    => I am thinking as one news source `anchor.fm`. However, for now, I add both `subdomain.domain.suffix`
       and `domain.suffix` into Muck Rack collections to be intersected with GDELT's.

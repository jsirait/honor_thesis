# Some ideas to pursue:


1. Page rank algorithm to rank news sources based on their links to other news sources of particular importance
    Questions:
    a. Can we run page rank algorithm with undirected edges?
    b. Can we incorporate node attributes such as weight for page rank algorithm?
    
2. Compare and contrast embeddings using *shallow encoders* and *GNN embedding*.
   We can quantify the difference by using the accuracy in downstream tasks such as classification.
   This can be used to see if **structure** alone is enough to characterize news sources or if we need other information such 
   as the details provided by Wikidata and Muck Rack.
   
3. Can we use GNN with weighted edges???
